# Project Arcade
### By Léo Neumuller, Jérémie Germond and Marine Poteau

**The goal of this project :**

Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.
To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plateform at run-time, your graphics libraries and your games must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at run-time.

**Interface sharing**

We share our interface with one other project group.
After turn-in, it will therefore be possible to run your games using their launcher and graphical libraries, and vice-versa.
